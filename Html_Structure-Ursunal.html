    <h1>DnD: guide on how to be a druid class in DND</h1>

<p1><pre>Druids are a very versatile class. Between their available archetypes,
   they’re able to serve mixes roles as scouts, strikers, blaster, support 
   casters, and controllers. Their spell list has a lot of unique options.
   There is a strong emphasis on area control spells, and most of the Druid’s 
   best spells require Concentration. By spellcaster standards, the Druid is relatively 
   simple to play because you so rarely need to track more than one ongoing effect,
   but it certainly doesn’t make them less fun or less powerful.</pre></p1>

<p2><pre>The Druid is primarily a spellcaster, and fills a role in the party similar to the Cleric, 
    serving as a Healer, Support, and Utility caster. However, their capabilities don’t end there.
    Several subclasses also allow the Druid to serve as an effective Defender or Striker in an 
    impressively broad and unique number of ways.Druids experience a dramatic power spike at 2nd 
    level when they gain their subclass, and the Circle of the Moon Druid remains among the most
    powerful builds at level 2 several years after the publication of the core rules. However, 
    despite their strengths, the Druid is not without challenges.Druid subclasses vary wildly in 
    complexity, and some druid subclasses like Circle of Spores are exceptionally hard to build 
    and play effectively, while some subclasses like Circle of the Land are extremely simply to 
    play so long as the player is comfortable managing their spells. Beyond the fluctuating complexity,
    druids also have notoriously poor AC due to their inability to wear metal armor, and with only d8 
    hit points they can be frail compared to similar classes like the Cleric.</pre></p2>
