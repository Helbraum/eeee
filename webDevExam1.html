    <h1>The brief history of japan<h1>
        <hr>
        <h4>i.  Ancient Japan<h4>
            <p><em>Ancient Japan</em> was settled about 35,000 years ago by <dfn>Paleolithic</dfn> people <br>
                from the Asian mainland. At the end of the last Ice Age, about<br>
                 10,000 years ago, a culture called the <dfn>Jomon developed</dfn>. Jomon hunter-gatherers <br>
                 fashioned fur clothing, wooden houses, and elaborate clay vessels.<br>
                 <samp>the Paleolithic (c. 50,000 BC – c. 12,000BC)</samp></p><br>
        <h4>ii. Classical Japan<h4>
            <p>The <em>Classical Period</em> opened with a big leap in the political,<br>
               social, and artistic aspects of the Japanese society, including <br>
               the fruition of the Yamato rule and the beginnings of Buddhism in Japan.<br>
                This formative stage is known as the <dfn>Asuka period</dfn>.<br>
                <samp>Classical Period (538 – 1185)</samp></p><br>
        <h4>iii.Feudal Japan<h4>
            <p>The <em>feudal era of Japan</em> consisted of three main periods, the <dfn>Kamakura period</dfn>, <br>
                <dfn>Muromachi period</dfn>, and <dfn>Azuchi-Momoyama period</dfn>, each named for the shoguns who <br>
                controlled Japan. During these periods, the Emperor technically controlled <br>
                the country, but in reality, the shogun had more political power.<br>
            <samp>Feudal Japan between 1185 CE and 1868 CE</samp></p><br>
        <h4>iv. Early Modern Japan<h4>
            <p><em>Early modern Japan</em>, witnessed the birth<br>
               of many of Japan's most enduring cultural and political attributes, as well as <br>
               the expansion of its basic geographic boundaries.<br>
            <samp>the period between 1600 and 1868</samp></p><br>
        <h4>v.  Modern Japan<h4>
            <p>The <em>modern history of Japan</em> is categorized in different timelines depending <br>
               on the perspective, in some from 1868 onwards, in others from 1912 to the present,<br>
               and in others from after <dfn>World War II</dfn>. <dfn>The Meiji Era</dfn>, lasting from 1868 to 1912,<br>
               was a time of great change for Japan<br>
             <samp>1868 onwards</samp></p><br>
